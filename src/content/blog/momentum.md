~ with an understanding of future impact

look, I hate meanings around: "You will never be in your 20th again", "Money comes and goes". it works if you are already secure by ur parents or you are stupid (or u are a truly optimistic person, that's not bad).

I'm more into gathering day-by-day momentum of being alive, traveling if you really have a need in this rest or work+travel for more inspiration (which is perfect for me), and ofc if you have enough money. I like to find smth special in the trees that I pass through or in the looks of people in the big city which has their own world inside and they rush somewhere, in the random dialogues on the street about the weather and sweet bun from the new bakery. I personally gather too much motivation from sky-scapers, I'm fun of cyberpunk or neopunk. Then I'm in the city with them, I can just stay and look at them for some time.

all life is a balance, it's our lifetime goal to find our equity. but at my age (early 20th) I prioritize study and work much more, I have no choice.
