We are our habits and as the man in the black golf who liked bitten apples said: “The first 30 years we form habits, the next 30 they form us.”

Toward the path of understanding yourself and your actions lies Awareness. What do you do it for? What drives you when you have the urge to do it? What do you expect from the outcome?

How can you start changing your habits?

🔄 Replace 🌱 Change 💭 Attitude

Replacing one thing with another. Catch your fucking hand when swiping through the bottomless feed of any social media site (ofc except the everything app (jk, or no?)). You don't need to scroll through that WorldStar post or see which coffee your friend bought. And you'll never find anything important there. I mean, you already know what you need to do and how. So just prepare a list of things you need to read, learn, and watch.

Change. It's not always simple, you need to change your environment. I'm not just talking about people, but what's around you at home and on your computer. Really just install a brand new OS and focus on a couple of apps.

Attitude. Attitude towards yourself, it's important not to smother yourself for sitting on your phone for 4 hours a day or just being afk all day. Everyone needs to unload, just mark it for yourself and live it.

Where you are now is your thoughts from the past. To change the future, you need to start changing your thoughts today.
