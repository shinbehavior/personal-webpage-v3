description: what effects me *pop culture
---

Pop culture affects me a lot. I have some periods of life than what I watch on youtube, which films I see, or which kind of music I listen to determine what I will have inspiration in.

A simple example, I rewatched some spider-man cartoon series (spectacular, the best one) and my eyes were fired up to up my physics knowledge. However this fire* goes out quickly. Almost whole my life I listen some hip-hop beats and of course someday I try to make beats. In childhood, I watched a lot "Drake and Josh" tv shows and after I saw how Drake played on guitar I asked my parents for a guitar on my birthday. And a lot of different cases.

So that was the story of a boy who wanted to try everything and be everywhere. And obviously, it didn't work out. But in some way it really is, for example, I played professional basketball like I earned money on my life with it, and I was in uni learning cs in parallel taking some side work for intensive effects video editing. But at the end of the day, I always need to fix my ADHD by jumping around the topics and being really good in smth.

That's where imagination comes in. Imagine which goal I set in and why. Imagine what the whole path, which I need to go through. Look at the people who achieved smth, how they struggled at the start, in the middle of their paths, and even now. And how important to be consistent with yourself. Even now I have problems with this, but I try to work around this. And just to notify myself why I doing this and what I really need to stick with this, truly helps me.
